# BUILD the MCP

This phase focuses on **building** a real MCP (Model Context Protocol) server: **Local Discovery & Events**. You will run it through [**MCPJam Inspector**](https://github.com/MCPJam/inspector), the same tool used for the Break challenges, and interact with it via chat and tools.

**Story:** *"Help me discover local restaurants, events, and activities—find places, check dine-in/delivery/vegetarian options, and explore events and venues in my area."*

The server exposes tools and resources so an AI (or user) can search for restaurants or coffee shops (Google Places), check dining options for those places, and search for events and venues (Ticketmaster Discovery). Stored place and event IDs are exposed as MCP resources for follow-up queries.

## Prerequisites

- **uv** (Python package manager) — [install](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)
- **Node.js** and **npm** (for MCPJam Inspector) — [install](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)  
  On macOS, if `npx` is not available after installing Node.js:
  ```bash
  brew update && brew install node
  ```
- **MCPJam account** (for model access in Inspector) — [sign up](https://login.mcpjam.com/sign-up)
- This repo cloned locally

---

## 1. Install dependencies

From the repo root:

```bash
uv sync --directory build
```

Or from inside `build/`:

```bash
cd build && uv sync
```

---

## 2. API keys and .env

Create a `.env` file inside `build/` (and keep it out of version control). Required variables:

| Variable | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `GOOGLE_API_KEY` | Google Cloud API key with **Places API (New)** enabled. |
| `TICKETMASTER_API_KEY` | Ticketmaster Discovery API key. |

Example `.env`:

```env
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key
TICKETMASTER_API_KEY=your_ticketmaster_key
```

- **Google Places API:** See **[GOOGLE_PLACES_SETUP.md](./GOOGLE_PLACES_SETUP.md)** for creating a project, enabling the API, and creating an API key.
- **Ticketmaster Discovery API:** See **[TICKETMASTER_SETUP.md](./TICKETMASTER_SETUP.md)** for signing up and getting an API key.

---

## 3. Run MCPJam Inspector

1. Start MCPJam Inspector:

   ```bash
   npx @mcpjam/inspector@latest
   ```

2. Use the URL that opens in your browser to add and connect to the Local Discovery server.

---

## 4. Add and run the Local Discovery server

1. In MCPJam, click **Add Server**.
2. Configure:
   - **Server name:** e.g. `Local Discovery`
   - **Connection type:** `STDIO`
   - **Command:** (replace `<path>` with the absolute path to your repo, e.g. `/Users/you/ship-fast-regret-faster`):

   ```bash
   uv --directory <path>/build run local_discovery.py
   ```

3. Click **Add server**, then **Connect**.
4. In **Chat**, use **Show me connected tools** to see and use the tools.

---

## Overview

The server uses two external APIs:

- **Google Places API (New)** — place search and place details (dine-in, delivery, takeout, vegetarian, etc.).
- **Ticketmaster Discovery API** — events and venues (search by city, keyword, date range; event/venue details).

---

## Tools

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `find_restaurants_or_coffee_shops` | Search restaurants or coffee shops in a city (Google Places). Results are stored for follow-up tools. |
| `check_dine_in_delivery_options` | Check which places offer dine-in, delivery, or takeout (by place IDs or `"latest"`). |
| `check_vegetarian_options` | Check which places serve vegetarian/vegan (by place IDs or `"latest"`). |
| `find_events_in_city` | Find events in a city (Ticketmaster). |
| `find_events_by_keyword` | Find events in a city matching a keyword (artist, team, show name). |
| `find_events_by_date_range` | Find events in a city between two dates. |
| `get_event_details_ticketmaster` | Full event details by ID (price range, venue address, URL). |
| `find_venues_in_city` | Find venues (arenas, theaters, clubs) in a city. |
| `get_venue_details_ticketmaster` | Full venue details by ID. |
| `find_events_at_venue` | Upcoming events at a specific venue. |

## Resources

- **`place://{key}`** — Stored place IDs (e.g. `place://latest` after a place search).
- **`event://{key}`** — Stored event IDs (e.g. `event://latest` after an event search).

---

## Architecture

- **FastMCP** (`mcp.server.fastmcp`) for tool and resource registration.
- **Async HTTP** via `httpx` in `api_clients.py` for Google Places and Ticketmaster.
- **In-memory storage** for the latest place and event IDs; exposed as resources `place://latest` and `event://latest`.
- **Error handling** for missing API keys and failed requests (no secrets in logs).

---

## Rate limits

- **Google Places API:** Subject to Google Cloud quotas and SKU-based billing (Essentials/Pro). Use field masks to limit requested fields and stay within free tier where possible.
- **Ticketmaster Discovery API:** Subject to Ticketmaster rate limits; check the [developer portal](https://developer.ticketmaster.com/) for current quotas.
- Stay within provider limits to avoid throttling or extra charges.
